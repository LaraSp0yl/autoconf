This is GNU autoconf 2.59 with patches.

The patches are those on the branch dev-nxg-20040116-add-fpp-support,
which add Fortran preprocessor support to lib/autoconf/fortran.m4

That's the only functional change to autoconf as such, however, it has
also had component.xml added to it, and it has had its Makefile.in's
modified by the automake patched for Starlink.  The procedure for that
is:
    
    rm config/missing
    aclocal -I config           # Important!
    automake --add-missing      # Adds patched `missing'
    autoconf
    ./configure --prefix=/export3/sun/buildsupport
    make
    install-manifest
