BRANCHES
========

dev-nxg-20040116-add-fpp-support
--------------------------------

Branch tag applied to automake and autoconf. 

The patches for adding FPP support, originally announced by Martin Wilck on
<http://sources.redhat.com/ml/autoconf-patches/2000-07/msg00287.html>,
will be added on this branch, and then merged onto the main
development branch, with an appropriate merge tag added then.  I'll
keep this branch, however, and when debugging that support, I'll do
the fixes on this branch and remerge them.  That way, I keep these
patches separate from the main ones I'll apply, plus it'll be easy to
generate a patch to 2.59 for eventual submission to the
autoconf-patches list.

Both the autoconf and automake trees on this branch were tagged, as
autoconf-2-59-fpp1 and automake-1-8-2-fpp1 respectively, on
2004-January-21.  They were then merged onto the trunk, and the
branches then tagged with dev-nxg-20040116-add-fpp-support-MERGED
